## :books: General info

* "_TensorFlow.js is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models._"

## :signal_strength: Technologies

* [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.
* [@tensorflow/tfjs-node v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node).
* [node.js v12 LTS](https://nodejs.org)
* [Lodash v4](https://lodash.com/), a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. It has lots of methods but is slow.
* [Javascript playground](https://stephengrider.github.io/JSPlaygrounds/), a sandbox for writing javascript code and seeing the result on the right.

## :floppy_disk: Setup

* type `node load-csv.js` in console terminal to see any console.logs.
* It was necessary to install Python on my PC for this to compile.
* Use 'chrome://inspect/#devices' in browser to run in Chrome developer tools.

## :computer: Code Examples

* result of typing: `node load-csv.js`

```javascript
Features [ [ 10, 20 ], [ 12, 22 ], [ 11, 21 ] ]
Labels [ [ 1 ], [ 1 ], [ 0 ] ]
testFeatures undefined
testLabels undefined
```

## :cool: Features

* to follow

## :clipboard: Status & To-Do List

* Status: returns Features and Labels but testFeatures and testLabels undefined - see Code Example
* To-Do: Run again and correct data.
