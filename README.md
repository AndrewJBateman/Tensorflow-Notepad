# TensorFlow Notepad

Code to learn to use TensorFlow in javascript, following Udemy Course [Machine Learning With Javascript].

"_TensorFlow.js is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models._"

This project uses the node.js tensorflow package: [@tensorflow/tfjs-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node) version 0.2.1 in [node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10.15.0 LTS.

## Notes

It was necessary to install Python on my PC for this to compile. 

Use 'chrome://inspect/#devices' in browser to run in Chrome developer tools.
